theming system-> one theme in all app screen

###Recomposition -> ui ke ussi part ko update karna jo change kiye ho, rest it won't touch any other composiable
just like the things works in components in react

###state -> it is a data that control app's ui



color = Color.Green -> compose graphics ui ->prebuilt color by
or we can also use color = color.resource somthing like this  -> custom color

#*** we can use Column layout -> vertically show the elements
#*** we can use Row layout -> Horizontal show the elements
#*** we can use Box layout -> Horizontal show the elements

##***** Space(modifier.) to give space between components

modifier k function agar multiple times use karna chah rhe to . se kar sakte hai like -> Modifier.background.fillMaxHeight
or agar modifier se bahar aana hai then , use karte hai

******* 8background -> color, shape
* LazyColumn -> work as recyclerView -> takes two values ui and items
* responsive and adaptive layout -> adjust in all types of screen -> height and width fix(hard code) n rakhe

*******************************************************************
    state Management -> app's brain (color etc) , how app will react on user's action
                        by remember{} -> yaad karke rakhta hai
                        mutuableStateOf -> pakad hold (najar rakhta hai) kr rakhta hai ui ko
                        remembersavable -> rotate me data delete ho jata hai, to ye hone se avoid karta hai

                        Reading and updating state -> CheckBox -> checked, onCheckedChange
                        State Hosting -> it centralize state -> state passing through another pta nhi bhai
